## About the Project

![Game Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6y2emj8.png)

In Horizon, players take on the role of a manager overseeing the construction and operation of a fully functional space base. Players must manage resources, expand the base, and ensure the well-being of their crew while dealing with unexpected events and the dangers of space travel.

With unique game mechanics such as dynamic events, resource management, and space exploration, players must make strategic decisions to ensure their survival in the final frontier.
